# TDD Development Checklists 🧪

## Overview
These checklists ensure consistent Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices throughout the ChecklistApp development. Follow these workflows to maintain high code quality and test coverage.

## 📋 Available Checklists

### 1. [TDD Development Workflow](./TDD-DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md)
The core TDD workflow checklist for daily development. Covers the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle and all essential TDD practices.

**Use when:**
- Starting any new development task
- Learning TDD workflow
- Need a quick reference for TDD steps

### 2. [Feature Implementation with TDD](./FEATURE-IMPLEMENTATION-TDD.md)
Complete guide for implementing new features using TDD methodology from planning to deployment.

**Use when:**
- Building new features
- Adding major functionality
- Planning feature architecture

### 3. [Git Workflow with TDD Guard](./GIT-TDD-WORKFLOW.md)
Git commands and workflows that work with TDD Guard enforcement, including commit strategies and troubleshooting.

**Use when:**
- Committing code changes
- Creating pull requests
- Dealing with TDD Guard blocks

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### For New Features
1. Start with [Feature Implementation with TDD](./FEATURE-IMPLEMENTATION-TDD.md)
2. Follow [TDD Development Workflow](./TDD-DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md) for each component
3. Use [Git Workflow with TDD Guard](./GIT-TDD-WORKFLOW.md) for commits

### For Bug Fixes
1. Write failing test that reproduces the bug
2. Follow [TDD Development Workflow](./TDD-DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md)
3. Commit using [Git Workflow with TDD Guard](./GIT-TDD-WORKFLOW.md)

### For Refactoring
1. Ensure existing tests pass
2. Refactor code
3. Verify tests still pass
4. Commit with `refactor:` prefix

## 🎯 TDD Principles

### The Three Laws
1. ❌ **You may not write production code until you have written a failing test**
2. ❌ **You may not write more of a test than is sufficient to fail**
3. ✅ **You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass**

### The TDD Cycle
```
RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → COMMIT
```

## 📊 Coverage Requirements

| Type | Minimum Coverage |
|------|-----------------|
| Overall | 80% |
| New Code | 90% |
| Critical Paths | 95% |
| UI Components | 85% |
| Services | 95% |
| Utilities | 100% |

## 🛠️ Essential Commands

```bash
# Start TDD session
npm run test:watch

# Run all tests
npm test

# Check coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test
npm test -- --grep="ComponentName"

# Visual test UI
npm run test:ui
```

## ⚡ Quick Tips

### Before Starting
- ✅ Pull latest from main
- ✅ Create feature branch
- ✅ Start test watcher
- ✅ Check initial coverage

### During Development
- ✅ Write one test at a time
- ✅ See it fail first
- ✅ Write minimal code to pass
- ✅ Refactor when green
- ✅ Commit frequently

### Before Committing
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Coverage maintained
- ✅ No skipped tests
- ✅ Linting passes

## 🚨 When TDD Guard Blocks You

1. **Tests Failing**: Fix the failing tests before committing
2. **Coverage Dropped**: Add tests to maintain coverage
3. **Linting Errors**: Run `npm run lint:fix`

## 📚 Learning Resources

### Internal Docs
- [Testing Strategy](../08-TESTING-STRATEGY.md)
- [TDD Workflow Guide](../TDD-WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md)

### Best Practices
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Keep tests fast (<100ms)
- One assertion per test
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies
