```

## 🏗️ Code Structure Created

### Services
- `/lib/services/database.ts` - Database operations with Dexie
- `/lib/services/checklist-service.ts` - Checklist CRUD operations
- `/lib/services/template-service.ts` - Template management
- `/lib/services/template-engine.ts` - Enhanced template system
- `/lib/services/qa-engine.ts` - Q&A session management

### Types
- `/lib/types/checklist.ts` - Checklist type definitions
- `/lib/types/qa.ts` - Q&A system types
- `/lib/types/sync.ts` - Offline sync types

### Tests
- All services have corresponding test files in `__tests__` folders
- Following TDD methodology with tests written first

## 🐛 Issues Fixed
1. **Database Migration Error**: Fixed version() call on open database
2. **TDD Guard Hook**: Resolved spawnSync ENOENT error
3. **Vitest Filter Issue**: Fixed "filter: 2" problem
4. **TypeScript Errors**: Added missing `order` property to ChecklistItems
5. **Template Merging**: Implemented comprehensive Q&A integration

## 🚀 Key Achievements
1. **100% Test Success Rate**: All 104 tests passing
2. **TDD Compliance**: Followed RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for all features
3. **Industry Templates**: 15+ specialized cleaning templates
4. **Smart Q&A**: Conditional logic and context-aware questions
5. **Offline Ready**: Sync queue structure in place

## 📝 Technical Decisions
1. **Dexie for IndexedDB**: Chosen for better TypeScript support
2. **UUID for IDs**: Ensures unique identifiers across offline/online
3. **Template Engine Pattern**: Separates template logic from services
4. **Session-based Q&A**: Maintains state through entire questionnaire

## 🔄 Next Steps (Week 2)
1. [ ] Template versioning support
2. [ ] Claude Vision AI integration for photo analysis
3. [ ] Export system (PDF, Markdown, PerfexCRM)
4. [ ] Mobile-first responsive design
5. [ ] PWA features with service worker

## 📌 Notes
- All code follows TDD principles with tests written first
- Maintaining >90% coverage for new features
- Using TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- Following Next.js 14+ best practices
