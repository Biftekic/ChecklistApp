# ChecklistApp - Professional Service Checklist Generator

## Overview

ChecklistApp is a web-based checklist generation system for professional service industries. The application provides multiple methods for creating customized checklists, starting with a template-based approach.

## 🎯 Core Implementation Priority

These five features are the **FIRST PRIORITY** for implementation. All other features are secondary and will be implemented in later phases:

1. **Template-Based Generation (MVP)**: Quick checklist creation from industry templates
2. **Interactive Customization**: Guided Q&A for tailored checklists  
3. **AI-Powered Intelligence**: Claude API for photo-based generation
4. **Professional Export**: PerfexCRM GraphQL export
5. **Mobile-Responsive Design**: Works on all devices

> **Important**: These core features must be fully implemented before any other features are considered. This ensures the product delivers complete value from the first release.

## Project Status

✅ **Week 1 Complete** - Mobile-Responsive Foundation implemented!
- Next.js 15 App Router structure ✓
- Mobile-first responsive design (390px to 4K) ✓
- Touch-optimized UI components ✓
- Core navigation and routing ✓

🚧 **Next: Week 2** - Template-Based Generation system

## Checklist Generation Methods

> **🔴 KEY FEATURE**: All generation methods include **full editing capabilities**. Every checklist is a draft that users can customize - select/deselect items, add custom tasks, modify details - before finalizing.

The system supports three approaches for checklist creation:

### 1. Template-Based Selection
Select from pre-built industry templates with full editing control:
- 13+ industry modules (cleaning, maintenance, healthcare, etc.)
- **Pick & Choose**: Select which rooms to include
- **Task Selection**: Choose specific tasks within each room
- **Full Editing**: Modify any task details or add custom ones
- Pre-defined tasks with adjustable time estimates
- Equipment and supply lists (customizable)
- Compliance standards integration

### 2. Interactive Q&A Generation
Build custom checklists through guided questionnaires with selection control:
- Progressive questions generate task options
- **Checkbox Selection**: All options shown with checkboxes
- **Choose What You Need**: Check only relevant tasks
- **Add & Edit**: Add missing items or modify suggestions
- Room-by-room customization with editing
- Automatic time calculations (adjustable)
- Dynamic task generation as editable starting point

### 3. AI-Powered Photo Recognition (Priority Feature)
Generate checklists from visual inspection with human oversight:
- Photo analysis for room/area identification
- Condition assessment using Claude Vision API
- **Review AI Results**: Remove incorrect detections
- **Add Missing Items**: Include tasks AI didn't detect
- **Full Editing**: Modify all AI-generated content
- Context-aware task generation (all editable)
- Smart suggestions as starting point
- Human validation of AI recommendations

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15+, React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **AI Integration**: Claude API (Anthropic)
- **PWA**: Service Workers, offline support
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
